inside the "data" folder in the repository.
The repository should be structured as follows:

	- Assignment2.ipynb
	- data
		- bank-additional-full.csv
	- readme.txt

Should the .csv file be moved to another directory, the python code on the first cell should be changed accordingly. 

To run the code and retrieve the outputs, follow these steps:
	Main menu -> Kernel -> Restart & Run All
